# pseudonumber
This project implements an Affine Cipher for text encryption and decryption, enhanced with a pseudo-random key generation mechanism inspired by memristor dynamics.

Instead of using a fixed key directly, the input key is transformed through a nonlinear memristor model to generate stronger, less predictable encryption parameters. The cipher supports a wide range of ASCII symbols and ensures cryptographic validity using modular arithmetic and inverse calculations.

## Key Features
Affine cipher–based encryption and decryption
Memristor-inspired chaotic key generation
Full printable ASCII character support
Validation of cryptographic key strength
Simple CLI-based interaction
This project blends classical cryptography with nonlinear dynamical systems to demonstrate an experimental approach to key generation.
